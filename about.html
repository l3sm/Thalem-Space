      <h1>About Thalem Space</h1>
      <p>
        Thalem Space is a collection of simple, open&#8209;source tools designed
        to help freelancers, indie makers and small teams work smarter. Each
        tool solves a specific problem, stays out of your way and respects
        your data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why open source? Because transparency builds trust. Our code is
        available for anyone to inspect, audit or improve. Purchases help
        support continued development and keep these projects alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why pay? Your contributions fund new features, bug fixes and the
        maintenance required to keep tools useful in the long term. You also
        get lifetime updates via our public releases, so you always have the
        latest version.
      </p>
      <p>
        No accounts needed. Tools run locally in your browser or on your
        operating system. When you buy a tool, you receive a link to its
        releases page where you can always download the latest version.
